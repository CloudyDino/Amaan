    <string name="about">I am a high school student with some basic programming knowledge with most of it in algorithmic programming. I\'ve been programming for about 6 years now but never have tried making software. This is the second time I have participated in Google Code-In because the first one got me interested in open-source. This is my first Android app as you can tell but I\'d like to get better by trying some more FOSSASIA tasks.</string>
